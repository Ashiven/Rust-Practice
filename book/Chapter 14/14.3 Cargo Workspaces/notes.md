-  `workspaces` can be used to manage sets of related packages
-  this is useful when we have a binary that depends on multiple libraries for example
-  we can specify a `workspace` by adding a **Cargo.toml** file in our `workspace` that contains the names of the crates under `[workspace]\n members = ["crate-name"]`
-  running `cargo build` in the `workspace` folder compiles all crates into the `target` directory
-  when we want to run a specific `package` in the `workspace`, we use `cargo run -p [package-name]`
-  running `cargo test` in a `workspace` will run the tests for all `crates` in the `workspace`
-  for particular testing, we use `cargo test -p [package-name]`
-  `cargo install` can be used to install binaries from crates.io
-  `cargo --list` shows all extensions and commands that can be used with `cargo`
