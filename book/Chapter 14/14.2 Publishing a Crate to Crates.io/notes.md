-  you can publish your own crates on Crates.io
-  there are `documentation comments` that start with `///` instead of `//`, and they support markdown notation
-  these are usually placed above the function they are documenting
-  we can view the generated documentation via `cargo doc --open`
-  common sections in a function's documentation are **Examples**, **Errors**, **Panics**, **Safety**
-  `cargo test` will also run the code examples in the documentation
-  `//!` is for comments about the crate or module itself and typically goes at the start of a module
-  having set up an account on crates.io and added your api key locally via `cargo login [api-key]`, you can publish a crate via `cargo publish`
