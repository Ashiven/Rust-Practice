-  we can use `paths` to tell Rust where to find items in the `module tree`
-  there are `relative paths`, starting at the current module, and `absolute paths`, starting at the `crate root`
-  paths are separated by double colons `::`
-  starting absolute paths with `crate` is the equivalent to starting a path in the filesystem with `/`
-  `parent modules` can not use the items inside of `child modules`
-  `child modules` on the other hand, can use the items of their `ancestor modules`
-  items can be made public by prefixing the `pub` keyword
-  using `super` at the start of a path is the equivalent to starting a path in the filesystem with `..`
-  `pub` can also be used to make `structs` and `enums` public
-  in contrast to `enums`, by default all of the fields of a `struct` are `private` and would have to be made `public` explicitly
-  if we put `pub` in front of an `enum` all of it's variants will be publically accessible
