-  we can pass arguments to the binary via the following syntax `cargo run -- arg1 arg2`
-  we use the `--` to indicate that the arguments are for the `binary` rather than for `cargo`
-  larger programs should start moving their logic to a library file `src/lib.rs`
-  `main.rs` should: call command line parsing logic with args, set up other config, call a `run` function in `lib.rs`, handle errors returned by `run`
