- `cargo new hello_cargo` to create new project with cargo
- `cargo build` to build and compile the project (binary saved in \target\debug) but not run it
- `cargo run` to build and compile and run the project
- `cargo check` to check whether the project code would compile but not compile it
- `cargo build --release` for the final build (this is like build but with some improvements and takes longer therefore)
