-  `enums` are used to create a set of related values which an element can be part of
-  an advantage of `enums` is that each variant can have different types and amounts of data associated with it
-  we can also define `methods` on `enums` with `impl`
-  there is an `Option` `enum` in the standard library which is used in the scenario where a value could be something or nothing
-  for example when accessing the first item in a list that could be empty
-  when we have a `Some` value, we know that a value is present, whereas when we have a `None` value we don't
