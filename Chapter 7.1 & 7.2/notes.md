-  there are `library crates` and `binary crates`
-  `binary crates` compile into executables, whereas `libary crates` define functionality to be shared with other projects
-  for example, the `rand crate` for random number generation is a `library crate`
-  a `package` is a bundle of one or more `crates` and always contains a `Cargo.toml`
-  `packages` can contain at most one `library crate` and as many `binary crates` as you want
-  a `package` has it's library crate in `src/lib.rs` and it's binary crates in `src/bin`
-  The following is a cheatsheet for all things regarding `modules`
-  Start from the crate root: When compiling a crate, the compiler first looks in the crate root file (usually src/lib.rs for a library crate or src/main.rs for a binary crate) for code to compile.
-  Declaring modules: In the crate root file, you can declare new modules; say, you declare a “garden” module with mod garden;. The compiler will look for the module’s code in these places:
   -  Inline, within curly brackets that replace the semicolon following mod garden
   -  In the file src/garden.rs
   -  In the file src/garden/mod.rs
-  Declaring submodules: In any file other than the crate root, you can declare submodules. For example, you might declare mod vegetables; in src/garden.rs. The compiler will look for the submodule’s code within the directory named for the parent module in these places:
   -  Inline, directly following mod vegetables, within curly brackets instead of the semicolon
   -  In the file src/garden/vegetables.rs
   -  In the file src/garden/vegetables/mod.rs
-  Paths to code in modules: Once a module is part of your crate, you can refer to code in that module from anywhere else in that same crate, as long as the privacy rules allow, using the path to the code. For example, an Asparagus type in the garden vegetables module would be found at crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus.
-  Private vs public: Code within a module is private from its parent modules by default. To make a module public, declare it with pub mod instead of mod. To make items within a public module public as well, use pub before their declarations.
-  The use keyword: Within a scope, the use keyword creates shortcuts to items to reduce repetition of long paths. In any scope that can refer to crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus, you can create a shortcut with use crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus; and from then on you only need to write Asparagus to make use of that type in the scope.
