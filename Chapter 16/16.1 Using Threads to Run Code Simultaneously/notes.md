-  threads can be used via `std::thread`
-  when the main thread completes, all spawned threats shut down, whether they have finished or not
-  if you want a spawned thread to terminate, you can use the threads return, which is a `handle`, and call `handle.join().unwrap()`
-  what `join` does, is to block the currently running thread until the threat represented by the `handle` terminates
-  it is often important to use `move closures` with spawned threads (see code examples for further elaboration)
